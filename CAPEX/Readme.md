# CAPEX data

## Sources

**For variable renewable + CSP** *($2019)*

IRENA (2020) Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2019 when data for 2014 is available. When it is not, the 2019 data is used to go "backwards" on the learning curve, assuming the relationship between the installed capacity and the investment costs hold for the 2014-2019 years. See the Capex_process.Rmd notebook for more details.

**For coal, gas, hydro and nuclear technologies** *($2019)* 

World Energy Outlook 2021 (IEA).

IMACLIM-R - WEO assumptions for technologies:
