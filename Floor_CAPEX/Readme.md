For renewables: 
- WDN, WNO, CPV: RTE (2021) "Bilan prévisionnel long terme  «Futurs énergétiques 2050", p. 83, in €2018, reference case
- RPV: Bogdanov et al (2015) in €2015
- CSP: no source, as the 2000€ from Bogdanov et al (2015) seemed very optimistic

For fossil fuels:
- ICG: IEA (2020) WEO 2020 assumptions in 2019$
- PFC, UCS, GGS and BIGGCS: no source, an additional 1000$ (USD2014) is added to the corresponding conventional technology
